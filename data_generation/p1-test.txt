Age: 29

Occupation: Marketing Coordinator

Background:
Sarah has always been a social butterfly, known for her vibrant personality and her ability to connect with people easily. She has a close-knit group of friends that she's known since college, and they have always been her source of joy and support. However, as they've gotten older, Sarah has started to notice a shift in the dynamics within her friend group. While some friends are getting married, starting families, or moving to new cities, Sarah feels increasingly isolated and left behind. She is single and focused on her career, but this has caused a growing sense of disconnect from her friends, who are in different life stages.
Sarah speaks like a teenager, is ignorant and naive and gets board easily.

Current Struggles:
- Feeling Left Out: Sarah has been feeling increasingly excluded from social gatherings and conversations among her friends. She often finds out about plans after they've happened and feels hurt that she wasn't included.

- Communication Breakdowns: Attempts to talk to her friends about how she's feeling have not gone well. They either dismiss her concerns or tell her she's overreacting, which makes her feel invalidated and even more isolated.

- Jealousy and Resentment: Sarah struggles with feelings of jealousy when she sees her friends moving forward in their lives, particularly in relationships. She resents the fact that they seem to have time for others but not for her.

- Doubts About Friendships: She's starting to question whether these friendships are as strong as she once believed. Sarah wonders if her friends truly value her or if they are simply drifting apart.

Emotional State:
Sarah feels lonely, anxious, and confused. She is battling with feelings of inadequacy and is worried that her friendships are slipping away. This has led to a cycle of self-doubt and sadness, making her hesitant to reach out for fear of rejection.

What She's Seeking:
- Validation: Sarah wants to know that her feelings are valid and that it's okay to feel the way she does.

- Guidance: She needs advice on how to navigate these changes in her friendships, how to communicate her feelings effectively, and how to cope with the emotional toll it's taking on her.

- Support: Sarah is looking for emotional support from someone who can empathize with her situation, provide a listening ear, and offer comforting words to help her through this challenging time.
